# Predicting Stock Prices using News Sentiment Analysis

News data is often indicative of a certain company's perception, and the associated value of its stock. In order to quantify this correlation, I scraped 100s of news articles for each of the companies in the S&P500 index, and calculated the prevailing sentiment regarding the company. I then used this sentiment to further map changes in the companies stock price using data from the Open and Close prices of the last 5 days combined with the current sentiment.

A brief demonstration of the project's workflow is shown here:
